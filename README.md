Timeless foundations for modern code.

### 🧭 About
POD HQ is a micro-lab focused on **object-oriented design**, **clean architecture**, and **long-term maintainability**.  
The goal is to explore and document the *principles* that make code timeless — not just functional.

### 💬 Philosophy
> “Code is not just to work; it must *endure*.”  
> — POD HQ

We believe great systems are built upon **clarity**, **composability**, and **consistency** —  
the three pillars of object design.
